# DND Types

## Introduction
Hello, down there!

This repository is an attempt to translate all the applicable D&D 5E SRD into Typescript.

The main aim is to create a system which makes it as easy as possible for further projects (such as a game server, UI, etc.) to interact with the mechanics of D&D.

The main principles are:
-   Content should be kept seperate from the definitions. This hopefully will make it easier to add on more content later.
-   Defining new content should be easy and declarative (see `/tests/SpellTest`).

## Contributing

Hey there, neighborino!

Feel free to add your own contributions and opinions to/about the code.

I have no idea about how this GitHub pull request thing works, but I'll try!

Main things are:
-   Pls use `PascalCase` for all public-facing properties/methods. Anything else is fair game, but preferably `camelCase`. 
-   Have fun ðŸ™„
